## How it started

I started learning cloud and website hosting in late 2020 and it was the first time I had used azure it was not a very good site but you can browse it [here](https://legacy.husky.nz/v1)
This was built on some broken understanding of how html and css worked and I had no idea how to build a website. I was also very new to git and github and I had no idea how to use it. but it was a good opportunity to learn and build something.

## peter.husky.nz

In early 2023 I decided that it was time to build a portfolio website and learn about NextJS so I found a nice template and started building off of it and I was happy with it at the time it was a nice and simple was to show my skills off but I was annoyed with my main site (https://www.husky.nz) and wanted to rebuild it into what it is now
