## Intro
Hello, today I want to talk about https://legacy.husky.nz. This is where I hope to show off old and/or what I consider "legacy" projects. Right now I have old versions of the HuskyNZ website from v1 to v6 (excluding v5, which I have not gotten working yet).

## The Idea
I had the idea sitting in my head for a year or so - the thought of "What if I could showcase some of my old work?" And today (Yes, it's been up for a few weeks, SHHHHHH) it's finally a reality. This was also a good little learning treat for me as I wanted to learn more about IIS and its *quirks*, and this was a perfect low-stakes project to play around with it. So I made use of virtual directories.

## The Index Design 
If you browse to the site, you will see a page that looks like it's ripped from the late 90's - that's by design as I wanted to have fun with it. So the site uses zero CSS and JS. And you can browse from v1 through to v6. If you're wondering where v4 and v5 are: v4 was a WordPress site that is long gone and no longer exists. As for v5, I'm working on getting it working.

## The progression in the sites
Overall, I think when you look through all the sites and see them one after another, it shows how much I learned from late 2020 to late 2022. It's very neat to see how v1 was very flawed, and that was okay. I think v2 is when it started to get somewhat okay, but then we grew further after that. I mean, look at the site you're reading this on.
